# 📘 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs — Study Journey

> “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” — Harold Abelson & Gerald Jay Sussman

This repository documents my study of the **first three chapters of *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)***.  
I worked through the exercises in Scheme, explored key programming abstractions, and built small projects to deepen my understanding of computation from first principles.

## 🧭 Overview

*SICP* is a foundational text in computer science that teaches:

- Procedural abstraction
- Data abstraction
- Recursion and higher-order functions
- Modularity, state, and objects

The first three chapters cover:

1. **Building Abstractions with Procedures**  
2. **Building Abstractions with Data**  
3. **Modularity, Objects, and State**  

Each chapter in this repo contains notes, exercises, and reflections on key concepts.

## 📚 Chapters & Key Achievements

| Chapter | Focus | Status | Highlights |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Building Abstractions with Procedures | ✅ Completed | Implemented recursive and higher-order procedures, practiced substitution model, built small numerical and symbolic programs in Scheme |
| 2 | Building Abstractions with Data | ✅ Completed | Explored pairs, lists, and symbolic data; practiced constructing hierarchical abstractions and manipulating data structures |
| 3 | Modularity, Objects, and State | 🚧 In Progress | Learned about assignment, environments, streams, and modular design patterns in Scheme |

## 💻 Technical Highlights

- Implemented **recursive procedures**, higher-order functions, and iterative algorithms in Scheme  
- Explored **procedural and data abstraction** through hands-on exercises  
- Built small **interpreters and evaluators** to understand evaluation and environments  
- Practiced **functional programming concepts**: map, filter, reduce, recursion patterns  
- Wrote reflections connecting theory to practical software design
